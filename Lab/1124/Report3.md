## Tasks
**Scheduling Algorithm Comparison**
- Implement the following scheduling methods: Round Robin, Priority, First-Come-First-Served, and Static Multilevel Queue (`proc.c`).
- Testing method (`test_scheduler.c`): Create 6 processes (including CPU-bound and I/O-bound), record the execution process of all processes, and compare the scheduling algorithms' results on average ready time, average running time, average sleep time, and average turnaround time.

## Environment
- M4 MacBook Air
- VMware Fusion Professional Version 13.6.3 (24585314)
- `Linux ubuntuserver 6.14.0-36-generic #36~24.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Oct 15 15:22:32 UTC 2 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux`
