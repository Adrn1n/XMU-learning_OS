## Question
### 2.1.
Suppose that we have a multiprogrammed computer in which each job has identical characteristics. In one computation period, $T$, for a job, half the time is spent in I/O and the other half in processor activity. Each job runs for a total of $N$ periods. Assume that a simple round-robin scheduling is used, and that I/O operations can overlap with processor operation. Define the following quantities:
- Turnaround time = actual time to complete a job
- Throughput = average number of jobs completed per time period $T$
- Processor utilization = percentage of time that the processor is active (not waiting)

Compute these quantities for one, two, and four simultaneous jobs, assuming that the period $T$ is distributed in each of the following ways:
- a. I/O first half, processor second half
- b. I/O first and fourth quarters, processor second and third quarter

### 2.2.
Contrast the scheduling policies you might use when trying to optimize a time-sharing system with those you would use to optimize a **multiprogrammed batch** system.

## Answer
### 2.1.
#### a.
1. 1 job
	- $N T$
	- $\frac{1}{N}$
	- $\frac{1}{2}$
2. 2 jobs
	- $N T, \frac{2 N + 1}{2} T$
	- $\frac{4}{2 N + 1}$
	- $\frac{2 N}{2 N + 1}$
3. 4 jobs
	- $(2 N - 1) T, \frac{4 N - 1}{2} T, 2 N T, \frac{4 N + 1}{2} T$
	- $\frac{8}{4 N + 1}$
	- $\frac{4 N}{4 N + 1}$

#### b.
1. 1 job
	- $N T$
	- $\frac{1}{N}$
	- $\frac{1}{2}$
2. 2 jobs
	- $N T, \frac{2 N + 1}{2} T$
	- $\frac{4}{2 N + 1}$
	- $\frac{2 N}{2 N + 1}$
3. 4 jobs
	- $(2 N - 1) T, (\frac{4 N - 1}{2}) T, 2 N T, \frac{4 N + 1}{2} T$
	- $\frac{8}{4 N + 1}$
	- $\frac{4 N}{4 N + 1}$

## 2.2.
Time-sharing system needs to make each user feel as if they own the machine exclusively. To achieve this, the scheduling policy must to switch processes rapidly and treat every user (process) fairly. Multiprogrammed batch system aim to maximize the CPU utilization and throughput. Therefore, the scheduling policy avoids frequent context switching and may prioritize processes according to their importance or priority.
