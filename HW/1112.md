### 8.6.
A process contains eight virtual pages on disk and is assigned a fixed allocation of four page frames in main memory. The following page trace occurs:
1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 7, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 5, 1, 5, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 2, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3
- a. Show the successive pages residing in the four frames using the LRU replacement policy. Compute the hit ratio in main memory. Assume that the frames are initially empty.
- b. ﻿﻿﻿Repeat part (a) for the FIFO replacement policy.
- c. ﻿﻿﻿Compare the two hit ratios and comment on the effectiveness of using FIFO to approximate LRU with respect to this particular trace.

### 8.10.
Assuming a page size of 4 Kbytes and that a page table entry takes 4 bytes, how many levels of page tables would be required to map a 64-bit address space, if the top-level page table fits into a single page?
